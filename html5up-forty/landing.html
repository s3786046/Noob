									<p>Personal Information

My full name is Sulaiman Sam Dayoub, however just Sulaiman Dayoub is more prevalent in my ID. My student number is s3786046, and my email address is gr4uman@gmail.com.
My nationality is Lebanese, and I am also a Muslim, pretty much meaning that I am restricted from doing lots of fun and reckless stuff. It does however give me a different view on life and how to approach lots of situations, thinking more about the future rather than just simply the present. This also means I speak Arabic to some extent as well as English. I learnt Italian in high school but I only ever learnt simple words and phrases so I wouldnâ€™t count it as a language I speak. I have just recently finished year 12 and received my VCE certificate, allowing me swift entry into RMIT University, which so far has been a pleasant experience. My main hobby that consumes the majority of my time is gaming. I have always been a gamer at heart since I first started playing console games back when I was 5 years old, starting with the Nintendo GameCube. In 2013 I started playing Team Fortress 2 on the computer and ever since then I have been part of the PC master race and have never looked back (excluding console exclusive titles that come out from time to time alongside classic titles.)

What is Sams interest in IT? When did Sams interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked Sams interest?

As mentioned earlier I started PC gaming in 2013 which allowed me grow attached to computers and what not. However I was much more focused on the gaming more so than the technicalities of computers, most of which I left for my brother to deal with. He worked an IT job for over 4 years which inspired me to look into IT as it seemed like a job I could be interested in. Mixed with the fact that IT is becoming increasingly interconnected with nearly every single job/business, this means that slotting a job in IT will be relatively easy compared to other niche fields, making the course seem attractive. I do not have any proper prior experience with IT, I just know my way around a windows computer fairly well and am slowly learning how to navigate the Mac.

Why did Sam choose to come to RMIT?

I chose RMIT not only because of its incredibly convenient location, but also its connection with businesses and hence their ability to both arm you for any future in the workforce, but also provide opportunities for jobs through their tight connections with businesses. This allows you to get a foot into the workforce, gain experience out in the field and allow your future to flourish in any way you wish it to. It is for both these reasons combined that RMIT seems to be the perfect choice to study the IT degree.


What does Sam expect to learn during his studies?

I expect to learn the essentials of every job connected to the degree so that I can be ready for any job that I chose to pursue. More particularly any skills related to networking and cloud computing as they are the ones that interest me the most. It would also tie into my ideal job of a network engineer which is being in a IT Network / Systems Administration job.

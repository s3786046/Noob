										<h2>About me</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Personal Information<p>

<br>My full name is Sulaiman Sam Dayoub, however just Sulaiman Dayoub is more prevalent in my ID. My student number is s3786046, and my email address is gr4uman@gmail.com.
My nationality is Lebanese, and I am also a Muslim, pretty much meaning that I am restricted from doing lots of fun and reckless stuff. It does however give me a different view on life and how to approach lots of situations, thinking more about the future rather than just simply the present. This also means I speak Arabic to some extent as well as English. I learnt Italian in high school but I only ever learnt simple words and phrases so I wouldn’t count it as a language I speak. I have just recently finished year 12 and received my VCE certificate, allowing me swift entry into RMIT University, which so far has been a pleasant experience. My main hobby that consumes the majority of my time is gaming. I have always been a gamer at heart since I first started playing console games back when I was 5 years old, starting with the Nintendo GameCube. In 2013 I started playing Team Fortress 2 on the computer and ever since then I have been part of the PC master race and have never looked back (excluding console exclusive titles that come out from time to time alongside classic titles.)
<br>

<br>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (If any).<br>

<br>As mentioned earlier I started PC gaming in 2013 which allowed me grow attached to computers and what not. However I was much more focused on the gaming more so than the technicalities of computers, most of which I left for my brother to deal with. He worked an IT job for over 4 years which inspired me to look into IT as it seemed like a job I could be interested in. Mixed with the fact that IT is becoming increasingly interconnected with nearly every single job/business, this means that slotting a job in IT will be relatively easy compared to other niche fields, making the course seem attractive. I do not have any proper prior experience with IT, I just know my way around a windows computer fairly well and am slowly learning how to navigate the Mac.
<br>

<br>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<br>

<br>I chose RMIT not only because of its incredibly convenient location, but also its connection with businesses and hence their ability to both arm you for any future in the workforce, but also provide opportunities for jobs through their tight connections with businesses. This allows you to get a foot into the workforce, gain experience out in the field and allow your future to flourish in any way you wish it to. It is for both these reasons combined that RMIT seems to be the perfect choice to study the IT degree.
<br>

<br>What do you expect to learn during your studies?<br>

<br>I expect to learn the essentials of every job connected to the degree so that I can be ready for any job that I chose to pursue. More particularly any skills related to networking and cloud computing as they are the ones that interest me the most. It would also tie into my ideal job of a network engineer which is being in a IT Network / Systems Administration job.<br>

												<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
											</header>
											<p>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</p>

<br>I feel they give you an indication of what type of person you are, however, they do not directly correlate to who you are as people can change overtime and can act differently in the same scenario in two similar occasions. They are more for fun than a serious indication.<br>

<br>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?<br>

<br>I believe these results may indicate a good connection with my teammates and hence teamwork will come seamlessly. However working along on certain areas may be a weak point in my behaviour and contribution to the team.<br>

<br>How should you take this into account when forming a team?<br>

<br>I should be aware of my individual work capabilities and talk to my teammates about helping me in particular situations if I ever feel the need for help or just feel stuck.<br>

												<h3>IT Project Idea</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Smart Wardrobe</p>

<br>Overview:<br>

<br>The idea of the smart wardrobe is to organize several pre-sets of clothes/outfits that are presented to you upon opening the wardrobe according to both the time of day and the current weather outside. The main purpose of the wardrobe is to save time choosing outfits and hence allow you to get straight into your day without the worry of choosing what to wear. There will of course be a manual option to create an outfit if you wish to, however it will automatically form pre-sets based on both your clothing options and personal preferences which will be entered when setting up the wardrobe.
<br>

<br>Motivation:<br>

<br>The key motivating factor in coming up with this idea is my own personal struggles with choosing what to wear in the morning alongside the lack of creativity in my personal outfits. I felt that if I am having these problems that there must be without question others in this world with those same issues. The Smart Wardrobe allows for a variety of different choices in clothing that is provided to you upon opening the wardrobe, speeding up preparation and keeping your look refreshing and always suited for the occasion.
<br>



<br>Description:<br>

<br>Initially, the wardrobe will custom tailored in size and capacity according to the users’ needs for the ultimate user experience. The wardrobe will be equipped with a large see through touch screen glass panel that displays and controls all the parts of the smart wardrobe, allowing for the user to set up a multitude of preferences that will allow the wardrobe to function on its own overtime. The panel will also display features such as forecasts, current fashion trends, suggest pieces of clothing that the user can purchase to complete some in fashion outfits as well as the time in the top corner of the display. The wardrobe will be linked to the internet as well as the users’ calendar, allowing for the wardrobe to be aware of the temperature and the location/dress-code of the event you will be attending. The wardrobe will have an input on the rightmost closet that accepts any clothing that the user places into it and sorts that clothing out into categories for both the wardrobe and the user to utilise. The user can setup and name his/her own pre-sets or allow the wardrobe to make its own pre-sets that the user can view and modify via the touch screen panel. The user will be given three main options: manually choosing pieces of clothing and hence using the smart wardrobe as a regular one whenever he/she wishes, allowing the smart wardrobe to come up with an outfit based on the time of the event and the occasion based off online trends and fashion databases through utilisation of present clothing that the user inputs into the system, and finally the user can set pre-sets of favourite outfits that they can bring out on command for maximum convenience. Those are the primary features of the wardrobe, however for extra costs the wardrobe can be fitted with attachments to further make the users’ experience truly unique. An example of an attachment the user could purchase is an ironing station that can be attached to the clothing input which automatically irons and handles any clothing present using robotic arms that detect and manoeuvre the clothing appropriately and carefully before placing said clothing into the wardrobe input for sorting. Although not specified above, the smart wardrobe caters for all pieces of clothing, not just torso and leg clothing. This ranges from: hats, gloves, shoes, scarves, ties etc. All of these features merge seamlessly together on the glass display to allow for the best possible user experience a wardrobe can provide on the market.
<br>

<br>Tools and Technologies:<br>

<br>The technology required to make the base smart wardrobe will be very advanced. It would require a mind that is not quite AI but is incredibly malleable and responsive to the users’ command alongside having the ability to perform actions on its own when ordered to. This would require an incredible amount of coding and utilisation of a fitted computer with WI-FI access that merges together seamlessly. The material of the wardrobe will be a variety of top end woods that the user can choose from to allow for a true custom experience. The parts of the wardrobe will have to move fluidly and swiftly which again would require immense coding and high-end metal material to form hangars and racks to store the clothing. The glass display will be incredibly hard to make and will have to merge together with the other parts of the wardrobe, requiring top end coding and carpentry. The user interface of the glass display will have to be seamless and intuitive, allowing for a comfortable and incredible custom-tailored user experience that melds all the parts of the wardrobe together.
<br>


<br>Skills required:<br>

<br>The skills required for the project will be top end programming to set up the glass display that will struggle greatly in the creation and integration of the interface with the main computer that controls the wardrobe. The materials for the wardrobe will have to work with each-other hence the programmers and the carpenters involved will have to work hand in hand with each-other, resulting in a great deal of communication and planning skills required.<br>

<br>Outcome:<br>

<br>The project is catered towards the high-end market. If the project is successful it will strongly impact the 1% of the world (rich people), changing the way they manage their wardrobes and speeding up their preparation times unimaginably. The project being successful would be a step in the direction of futuristic products that are aware and function automatically, opening doors for other futuristic options to appear in the market and ever so slowly upgrading and developing the technological aspect of the world.<br>
